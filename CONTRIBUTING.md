# Contributing
This repository accepts contributions.  Ideas, questions, feature requests and
bug reports can be filed through GitHub issues.

Pull Requests are welcome on GitHub.  By committing pull requests, you accept
that your code might be modified and reformatted to fit the project coding style
in order to improve the implementation.  Contributed code is considered licensed
under the same license as the rest of the project unless explicitly agreed
otherwise.  See the `LICENSE-ZLIB` and `LICENSE-APACHE` files.

Please discuss what you want to see modified before filing a pull request if you
don't want to be doing work that might be rejected.

## git workflow

Please file PR's against the `master` branch (it's the default, so super easy!).
